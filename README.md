JumpDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It
holds the utilities for building jump equations, like Gillespie SSA and jump
diffusions. Users interested in using this functionality should check out
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
