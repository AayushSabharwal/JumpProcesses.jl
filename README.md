DiffEqJump.jl is a component package in the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) ecosystem. It
holds the utilities for building jump equations, like Gillespie stochastic Simulation Algorithms (i.e. Kinetic Monte Carlo methods) and jump
diffusions, and is one of the core solver libraries included in [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl). 
Users interested in using this functionality should see the 
[DifferentialEquations.jl documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/).
